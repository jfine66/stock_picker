A project part of The Odin Project course. Task is has follows:

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.
Examples: 
stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10]) #=> [1,4] because buying day one at $3 and selling on day 4 for $15 is the hightest profit at $12.  

stock_picker([19,5,8,11,1,10,8,3,12]) #=>
[4,8] because buying on day 4 at $1 and selling at day 8 for $12 is the highest profit at $11.
